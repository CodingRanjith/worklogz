# 🎯 Dynamic Earnings & Employee Engagement System

## ✨ Overview
Complete employee motivation and engagement platform with **transaction-based dynamic earnings tracking**.

---

## 📊 **1. DYNAMIC EARNINGS SYSTEM (Transaction-Based)**

### How It Works:
✅ **Every day, when admin applies daily credits, a TRANSACTION is created**
✅ **Frontend shows REAL accumulated data, NOT calculations**

### Example:
```
Day 1 (Monday):
- Admin applies credits → Transaction created: ₹100
- Display: Today=₹100, Week=₹100, Month=₹100, Total=₹100

Day 2 (Tuesday):
- Admin applies credits → Transaction created: ₹50
- Display: Today=₹50, Week=₹150, Month=₹150, Total=₹150

Day 3 (Wednesday):
- Admin applies credits → Transaction created: ₹75
- Display: Today=₹75, Week=₹225, Month=₹225, Total=₹225
```

### Backend:
- **Model**: `DailyEarningTransaction` - stores each day's earning
- **Controller**: `dailySalaryController.js`
  - `getUserDailyEarnings()` - fetches TODAY's transaction, sums WEEK and MONTH
  - `applyDailyCredits()` - creates transactions when credits are applied
  
- **Database Collections**:
  1. `dailysalaryconfigs` - Admin configurations
  2. `dailyearningtransactions` - Daily transaction records
  3. `users` - User totals (dailyEarnings field)

### Frontend Display:
```javascript
{
  today: data.data.todayEarnings,      // From TODAY's transaction
  thisWeek: data.data.weeklyEarnings,  // SUM of this week's transactions
  thisMonth: data.data.monthlyEarnings,// SUM of this month's transactions
  total: data.data.dailyEarnings       // Total accumulated all-time
}
```

### Month-End Reset:
- Transactions stay in database
- Monthly/Weekly sums automatically recalculate based on date ranges
- No manual reset needed!
