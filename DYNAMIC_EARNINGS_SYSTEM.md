# 🎯 Dynamic Daily Salary Credit System

## ✨ Now 100% Dynamic Based on Admin Settings!

### How It Works:

## 🔄 Complete Flow:

### 1️⃣ **Admin Creates Configuration**
Admin goes to **Daily Salary Credit** page and creates:

**Example Config 1:**
- Name: "Daily Attendance Bonus"
- Amount: ₹100
- Applies To: All Employees
- Active: ✅

**Example Config 2:**
- Name: "Engineering Bonus"
- Amount: ₹50
- Applies To: Engineering Department
- Active: ✅

**Example Config 3:**
- Name: "Star Performer Bonus"
- Amount: ₹75
- Applies To: Specific User (e.g., Ranjith)
- Active: ✅

---

### 2️⃣ **Backend Dynamically Calculates**

When employee views their earnings, backend:

✅ **Finds all active configurations**
✅ **Checks which ones apply to this user**
✅ **Calculates total daily rate**

**Example for Engineering Department Employee:**
- Base Bonus: ₹100 (All Employees)
- Dept Bonus: ₹50 (Engineering)
- **Total Daily Rate: ₹150 per day**

**Example for Ranjith (Engineering + Star Performer):**
- Base Bonus: ₹100 (All Employees)
- Dept Bonus: ₹50 (Engineering)
- Star Bonus: ₹75 (Specific User)
- **Total Daily Rate: ₹225 per day**

---

### 3️⃣ **Frontend Shows Dynamic Data**

Employee sees:

📱 **Today's Earnings**
- Shows: Current daily rate (₹100, ₹150, ₹225, etc.)
- Based on: Active configs that apply to them

📅 **This Week**
- Shows: Daily rate × days this week
- Example: ₹150 × 5 days = ₹750

📆 **This Month**
- Shows: Daily rate × days this month
- Example: ₹150 × 20 days = ₹3,000

💰 **Total Accumulated**
- Shows: All-time total from database
- Never resets

⚙️ **Active Configurations**
- Lists all configs applying to this user
- Shows individual amounts
- Shows total daily rate
